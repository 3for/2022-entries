## Optimization of Accelerating MSM Operations on GPU Explained

The only optimization that we used in this project is curve isogeny. We have achieved 1.1X ~ 1.21X performance improvement compared to the original benchmark.

### Curve Isogeny / Endomorphism

A important feature of Elliptic Curves is that they are often isomorphic and can be transformed to another curve. Tthe general curve form is Weierstrass Form: 

$y^2 + a_1xy + a_3y = x^3 + a_2x^2 + a_4x+a_6 \mod \mathbb{F}_p$

It can be transformed to Short Weierstrass Form:

$y^2=x^3+ax+b \mod \mathbb{F}_p$

where characteristic of $\mathbb{F}_p$â€‹ is not 2 or 3 . This transformation method is called Curve Isogeny.

The point addition on Short Weierstrass Curves costs 11M+5S according to http://www.hyperelliptic.org/EFD/g1p/auto-shortw-jacobian-0.html#addition-add-2007-bl. Mixed point addition costs 7M+4S according to http://www.hyperelliptic.org/EFD/g1p/auto-shortw-jacobian-0.html#addition-madd-2007-bl.

Short Weierstrass Curves is not the fastest curve that point addition/mixed addition takes place. Another well known curve form is Twisted Edwards Curves, introduced by Daniel Bernstein et al in 2008 in their paper [Twisted Edwards Curves](https://eprint.iacr.org/2008/013.pdf). The curve formula is depicted as below:

$ax^2+y^2=1+dx^2y^2 \mod \mathbb{F}_p$

It has the fastest point addition by far and we can also have unified point addition formula. ZCash team used this trick to generate a Baby JubJub curve on top of BLS12-381. However their purpose is not to accelerate MSM, but to make use of the unified point addition formula and simplify their signature circuit.

The cost of unified addition on Twisted Edwards Curves can be reduced to 8M+1k according to http://www.hyperelliptic.org/EFD/g1p/auto-twisted-extended-1.html#addition-add-2008-hwcd-3, while mixed addition costs 7M+1k according to http://www.hyperelliptic.org/EFD/g1p/auto-twisted-extended-1.html#addition-madd-2008-hwcd-3, by introducing an extra field element record $t = x*y$ though, as described in Huseyin Hisil et al. paper [Twisted Edwards Curves Revisited](https://iacr.org/archive/asiacrypt2008/53500329/53500329.pdf).

An natural idea of optimizing MSM is to utilize curve isogeny, which means we transform all the points on BLS12-377 to its isomorphic Twisted Edwards curve at the very beginning, run MSM on that curve and finalize the result, then transform from Twisted Edwards curve back to BLS12-377. We can have all the nicely features of Twisted Edwards curve, while retaining the general Short Weierstrass curve representation.

Not all Short Weierstrass Curves can be transformed to Twisted Edwards Curves. According to https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montgomery_curve, we know that under certain conditions, a Short Weierstrass Curve is isomorphic to a Montgomery Curve, and a Montgomery Curve is isomorphic to a Twisted Edwards Curve. In order to transform from Short Weierstrass to Montgomery form, We quote:

> In contrast, an elliptic curve over base field $\mathbb{F}$ in Weierstrass form $E_{a,b}: v^2 = t^3+at+b$ can be converted to Montgomery form if and only if has order divisible by four and satisfies the following conditions:
>
> 1. $z^3 +az+b=0$ has at least one root $\alpha \in \mathbb{F}$; and
> 2. $3\alpha^2+a$ is a quadratic residue in $\mathbb{F}$
>
> When these conditions are satisfied, then for $s = (\sqrt{3\alpha^2+a})^{-1}$ we have the mapping
>
> $\psi^{-1}: E_{a,b} \rightarrow M_{A, B}$
>
> $(t, v) \mapsto (x, y)=(s(t-\alpha, sv)), A = 3\alpha s, B=s$

Then from Montgomery to Twisted Edwards, we quote:

> $2\frac{a+d}{a-d} =A$
>
> $\frac{4}{a-d}=B$ 
>
> $(u, v) \mapsto (u/v, (u-1)/(u+1))$

and that's it!

Very luckily, BLS12-377 can be transformed. The Short Weierstrass Form equation of BLS12-377 is: 

$y^2 = ax^3 +b \mod \mathbb{F}_p$

with 

$a = 0, b=1, p = 258664426012969094010652733694893533536393512754914660539884262666720468348340822774968888139573360124440321458177$

We choose

$A=30567070899668889872121584789658882274245471728719284894883538395508419196346447682510590835309008936731240225793$

$B=113327392486723791340039350366245770860783363395096105577549129978801514727083865406602966047408507739599254478215$

for its Montgomery isogeny $M_{A, B}$, then transform to $E_{a, d}$ with

$a=157163064917902313978814213261261898218646390773518349738660969080500653509624033038447657619791437448628296189665$

$d=101501361095066780517536410023107951769097300825221174390295061910482811707540513312796446149590693954692781734188$

We can even optimize further by making $a=-1$ using its endomorphism. The process is rather simple and can be found on paper, we are not going to demonstrate it here.

So the finalized point addition optimization is rather straight forward. First we transform and store all the base points which are on BLS12-377 to another set of base points on a Twisted Edwards curve that is isomorphic to BLS12-377. Second we do the MSM (mainly operations are point additions/mixed point additions) on it and get an accumulated point. Finally we transform that single point to BLS12-377 again. The point transform cost is either pre-calculated or just a single point, so we consider it trivial.

Since MSM is mostly used to commit to a polynomial, those base points are always fixed. This optimization approach should be valid for all ZKP systems, as long as the curve transformation is valid.

### Benchmark Explained

Before running MSM, we need to convert all the base points on BLS12-377 to extended Twisted Edwards curve points. When converting, beware that we correctly transformed the point at infinity. The point at infinity is represented by $(0, 0)$ on BLS12-377, $(0, 1)$ on Twisted Edwards curve.
