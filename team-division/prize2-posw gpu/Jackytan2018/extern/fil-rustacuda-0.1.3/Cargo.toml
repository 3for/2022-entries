# When uploading crates to the registry Cargo will automatically
# "normalize" Cargo.toml files for maximal compatibility
# with all versions of Cargo and also rewrite `path` dependencies
# to registry (e.g., crates.io) dependencies.

# If you are reading this file be aware that the original Cargo.toml
# will likely look very different (and much more reasonable).
