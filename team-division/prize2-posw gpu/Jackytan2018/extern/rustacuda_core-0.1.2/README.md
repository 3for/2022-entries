Minimal kernel-support crate for [RustaCUDA](https://github.com/bheisler/RustaCUDA).

This crate contains a small number of types which can be helpful when compiling Rust code to PTX
for use with RustaCUDA. It is not a general-purpose kernel support crate, and it is not intended to
be used in a standalone manner.
